This is an edited version with added Twitter Bootstrap components. If you use this project in a mobile format, it will automatically reorganize the html content to provide a neat format. It's pretty neat.

Several folders for the javascript/css/etc were added, therefore, I made a new folder rather than pushing to the other ones. We should aim to use this from now on when we work on C#/database stuff.

It's a good baseline for our front end. Eventually, we will clean it up, and make things common across all pages. Now we can focus on functionality without worrying about trivial front end stuff.
