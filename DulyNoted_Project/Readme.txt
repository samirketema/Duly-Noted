The db folder stores all the database scripts
The site folder is like a root folder for our websites

the hosting service provider is myasp.net

--database-- 
since the database is managed on the hosting site, I will be reponsible for deploying the database
If there is any change to current database, feel free to change the scripts in the db folder and let me know so I can update on the hosting server.

--website--
ftp server: ftp.myasp.net
ftp user: dulynote
ftp pass: dulypass

I recommend you to use FileZilla for ftp client :)
